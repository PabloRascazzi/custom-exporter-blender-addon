# Custom Exporter Blender Add-on

## Description

This is a custom exporter add-on used to export blender objects in an easy to read binary format with all the data processing done while exporting, and it works for multiple graphics APIs such as OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX.
Currently, the add-on only supports exporting meshes, but has a variety of export options such as vertex attributes, vertex buffer format, and primitive topology.
This add-on was created for educational purpose and will most likely have more updates including bug fixes and new features.
